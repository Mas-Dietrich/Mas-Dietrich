My Stack
------
I'm particularly passionate about front-end development, these are some of the languages I've been really loving lately!
| Languages + Frameworks | Why I'm a fan |
|----------:|-----|
|JavaScript|It's the root of all I know!|
|SvelteKit|I'm astonished at how simple complex things can be with SvelteKit!|
|PHP|Working as a WordPress developer at my job, I've been diving deeper into what makes things work in WordPress!|
|Tailwind|The amount of extra sleep I've been given because of the power of Tailwind is unreal.|
|3JS|I never imagined I would be able to work with things like 3D models, but 3JS has made me feel unstoppable!|
|MongoDB|It has been such a nice way for me to get my toes in the water in the world of back-end and full-stack!|
